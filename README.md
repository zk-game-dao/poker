# ZkPoker/PurePoker: Decentralized Poker on the Internet Computer

ZkPoker and PurePoker are fully decentralized poker platforms built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), offering provably fair poker games with on-chain randomness, transparent transactions, and a trustless gaming environment.

## 🌟 Features

- **Provably Fair Gameplay**: Leveraging the Internet Computer's on-chain randomness via VRF
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Play with ICP, CKBTC, CKETH, and other ICRC-1 tokens
- **Tournament System**: From sit-and-gos to multi-table tournaments with flexible structures
- **Leaderboard & Rewards**: Competitive leaderboards with automated reward distribution
- **Proof of Humanity**: Integration with DecideAI to prevent multi-accounting and collusion

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The platform is built on a modular canister architecture designed for scalability, fault isolation, and efficient resource utilization:

### Core Index Canisters

- **Users Index (`users_index.rs`)**: Manages user accounts and user canisters
- **Table Index (`table_index.rs`)**: Handles table creation, discovery, and lifecycle management
- **Tournament Index (`tournament_index.rs`)**: Orchestrates poker tournaments of various formats

### Game Logic Components

- **Table Canister (`table_canister.rs`)**: Implements core poker logic and game states
- **Tournament Canister (`tournament_canister.rs`)**: Manages tournament-specific functionality
- **User Canister (`users_canister.rs`)**: Stores user data, balances, and statistics

### Infrastructure Services

- **Cycle Dispenser (`cycle_dispenser.rs`)**: Manages cycle distribution across the system
- **Log Store (`log_store.rs`)**: Records game actions for transparency and verification

## 🛠️ Technical Components

### User Management System

The users index creates and manages user canisters, with each user canister able to store up to 1,000 user accounts. This enables efficient scaling as the platform grows.

```
users_index (principal: lvq5c-nyaaa-aaaam-qdswa-cai)
├── user_canister_1 (1000 users)
├── user_canister_2 (1000 users)
└── ...
```

### Table System

Tables operate as independent canisters containing the full poker logic. The table index manages their lifecycle and provides discovery functionality.

```
table_index (principal: zbspl-ziaaa-aaaam-qbe2q-cai)
├── cash_table_1
├── cash_table_2
└── ...
```

### Tournament System

Tournaments run as independent canisters that coordinate multiple table canisters, handle player movement between tables, and manage prize pools.

```
tournament_index (principal: zocwf-5qaaa-aaaam-qdfaq-cai)
├── tournament_1
│   ├── table_1
│   ├── table_2
│   └── ...
├── tournament_2
└── ...
```

### Cycle Management

The cycle dispenser ensures all canisters have sufficient cycles to operate:

```
cycle_dispenser
├── tops up users_index
├── tops up table_index
└── tops up tournament_index
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/zkpoker.git
cd zkpoker
```

2. Start the local Internet Computer replica:
```bash
dfx start --clean --background
```

3. Deploy the project:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh local
```

4. Start the local frontend development server:
- For ZKPoker
```bash
npm run start:zkp
```
- For PurePoker
```bash
npm run start:pp
```

5. Access the frontend:
```
http://localhost:5173/
```

### Production Deployment

1. Deploy to the IC mainnet:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh mainnet
```

### Update Candid Definitions

To update the .did files for all canisters:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh update all
```

Or for specific canisters:
```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh update users_index table_canister
```

## 🧩 Canister Structure

| `users_index` | User management orchestrator | Creates and manages user canisters, handles leaderboards |
| `users_canister` | User data storage | Stores user profiles, balances, and statistics |
| `table_index` | Table factory and registry | Creates, tracks, and manages poker tables |
| `table_canister` | Poker game logic | Implements game rules, betting, and card dealing |
| `tournament_index` | Tournament organizer | Creates and manages tournament structures |
| `tournament_canister` | Tournament logic | Handles tournament progression and table balancing |
| `cycle_dispenser` | Cycle management | Distributes cycles to maintain system operation |
| `log_store` | Action logging | Records game actions for verification |

### Testing

Run the test suite with PocketIC (local IC simulator):

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

You can also run specific tests:

```bash
./scripts/run-tests.sh basic_tests
```

These tests use PocketIC to create a simulated IC environment, which will be automatically downloaded the first time you run the tests.
